# Part1
# Find the most common and the least common bit sequence.
# Multiply least common decimal to most common decimal.
# In example data, gamma rate is the binary number 10110, or 22 in decimal.
# The epsilon rate is 01001, or 9 in decimal. 
# Multiplying the gamma rate (22) by the epsilon rate (9) produces the power consumption, 198.
